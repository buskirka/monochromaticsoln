Code for resolving questions in Ramsey theory of the form
```
Given k, f:N^j->R a linear function and a relation R (either =, <, or <=), 
what is the greatest possible natural number m such that there exist colorings
C: {1,...,m} -> {1,...,k} where if R(f(x_1,x_2,...,x_j),0) then it is not the 
case that C(x_1)=C(x_2)=...=C(x_j).
